# IMPORTANT: Install BEFORE setting NODE_ENV=production, otherwise npm skips devDependencies
# Required in production for:
# - vite: imported by server/vite.ts (even though only dev mode uses it)
# - drizzle-kit: needed for database migrations at runtime
# - tsx: required by drizzle-kit to read TypeScript schema files
RUN npm ci

# Set NODE_ENV after npm install to avoid skipping devDependencies
ENV NODE_ENV=production
