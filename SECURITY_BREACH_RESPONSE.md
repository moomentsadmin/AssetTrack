# 🚨 SECURITY BREACH RESPONSE - Exposed Credentials

## Critical Issue
The `attached_assets/` folder containing **database passwords, secret keys, and access credentials** was committed to the GitHub repository.

**Files with exposed credentials:**
- `Pasted--root-assettest-AssetTrackr-Test-API-docker-compose-f-docker-compose-ssl-external-db-yml-exe-1760598285875_1760598285875.txt`
- `Pasted-root-dockpeek-Clone-repository-git-clone-https-github-com-moomentsadmin-AssetTrackr-git-cd--1760527799317_1760527799317.txt`
- Multiple other files with sensitive deployment information

---

## ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Remove Files from Git History (DO THIS FIRST)

**Option A: Using BFG Repo-Cleaner (Fastest)**
```bash
# Install BFG
# macOS: brew install bfg
# Linux: Download from https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/

# Clone a fresh copy
cd ~
git clone --mirror https://github.com/moomentsadmin/AssetTrack.git

# Remove folder from history
bfg --delete-folders attached_assets AssetTrack.git

# Cleanup
cd AssetTrack.git
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Force push
git push --force
```

**Option B: Using the Provided Script**
```bash
# On your local machine
cd ~/AssetTrack
chmod +x REMOVE_SENSITIVE_FILES.sh
./REMOVE_SENSITIVE_FILES.sh

# Follow the prompts and force push when done
```

**Option C: Manual Git Filter-Branch**
```bash
cd ~/AssetTrack

# Remove from entire history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  'git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch attached_assets' \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Clean up
rm -rf .git/refs/original/
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Force push to GitHub
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

---

### 2. Rotate ALL Exposed Credentials (DO THIS IMMEDIATELY)

#### Database Credentials
```bash
# DigitalOcean Managed Database
# 1. Go to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases
# 2. Select your database
# 3. Settings → Reset Password
# 4. Update .env on production server with new password
```

#### Session Secrets
```bash
# Generate new secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Update on production server
nano .env
# Replace SESSION_SECRET with new value
```

#### Any Other Exposed Credentials
- **SMTP/SendGrid API Keys**: Rotate immediately
- **Any other API keys**: Rotate immediately
- **SSL certificates**: Consider regenerating if paths were exposed

---

### 3. Update Production Environment

```bash
# SSH to production server
ssh root@your-server

cd ~/AssetTrack

# Update environment file with NEW credentials
nano .env

# Restart application with new credentials
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

---

### 4. Verify Removal from GitHub

```bash
# Search GitHub for exposed data
# Go to: https://github.com/moomentsadmin/AssetTrack
# Use GitHub's search: filename:attached_assets

# If still visible:
# 1. Contact GitHub Support to clear cache
# 2. Or wait 24-48 hours for cache to clear
```

---

## 🔒 Prevention Measures

### ✅ Already Implemented
- [x] Added `attached_assets/` to `.gitignore`
- [x] Created removal script
- [x] Documented security breach response

### 🚀 To Implement Now

#### 1. Update .gitignore
```bash
# Verify attached_assets is ignored
cat .gitignore | grep attached_assets

# Should show: attached_assets/
```

#### 2. Add Pre-commit Hook
```bash
# Create .git/hooks/pre-commit
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Prevent committing sensitive files

if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "attached_assets/"; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Attempting to commit attached_assets/ (contains sensitive data)"
    echo "Please remove these files from the commit."
    exit 1
fi

if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q ".env"; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Attempting to commit .env file"
    echo "Environment files should never be committed."
    exit 1
fi
EOF

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

#### 3. Delete Local attached_assets Folder
```bash
# Remove from local filesystem
rm -rf attached_assets/

# Verify it's gone
ls -la | grep attached_assets
# Should return nothing
```

## 📋 Security Checklist

After completing the above steps:

- [ ] Removed `attached_assets/` from entire Git history
- [ ] Force pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Verified files don't appear in GitHub UI
- [ ] Rotated database password
- [ ] Rotated session secret
- [ ] Rotated any API keys that were exposed
- [ ] Updated `.env` on production server with new credentials
- [ ] Restarted production application
- [ ] Added `attached_assets/` to `.gitignore`
- [ ] Deleted local `attached_assets/` folder
- [ ] Created pre-commit hook to prevent future exposure
- [ ] Monitored for unusual database access
- [ ] Reviewed audit logs for suspicious activity

---

## 🚨 If Credentials Were Already Compromised

Signs to watch for:
- Unusual database connections
- Unexpected data modifications
- High server resource usage
- Failed login attempts from unknown IPs

**Response:**
1. **Immediately** disable the exposed database user
2. Create new database user with different password
3. Update application configuration
4. Review database audit logs
5. Consider hiring security professional for audit

## 🔐 Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Never commit:**
   - `.env` files
   - `attached_assets/` folder
   - Files with "password", "secret", "key" in them
   - Database connection strings
   - API credentials

2. **Always use:**
   - `.gitignore` for sensitive folders
   - Environment variables for secrets
   - Replit Secrets for development
   - Pre-commit hooks for validation

3. **Regular security:**
   - Rotate credentials every 90 days
   - Review `.gitignore` before commits
   - Audit Git history monthly
   - Use `git-secrets` or similar tools
